    "Few things are more inspiring than a comeback in sports. When a team that has dug themselves a hole manages to reverse the momentum of the game, it creates an emotional rollercoaster that players, coaches and fans can all experience together. However, for every Disney movie that sports comebacks have inspired, there is also a crowd full of devastated fans. There is even a term to describe the instinctive pose when one's team has collapsed before their eyes: the surrender cobra. Personally, I think college football comebacks are the most exciting of all. Unlike baseball, football has a clock, so this adds an extra challenge in for teams trying to stage a comeback. It's not just about making up the point difference... it has to be done before the clock hits 0:00. Unlike basketball, points can come in larger chunks, so a single play can have more weight on the outcome of a football game than typical jump shots, blocks, steals, etc. do in basketball. Having grown up in the state of Alabama and walked on to Auburn's team, I could be biased, but a football comeback is tough to beat.\n",
    "\n",
    "With this in mind, I wanted to know more about the people behind these comebacks: the head coaches. Some coaches are solemn strategists who remain unflappable while facing a hefty deficit. Others are fiery competitors who can spontaneously deliver an inspirational speech, chest bump the players or chew out a ref to get their teams going. Others are a mixture of both. Regardless, some coaches just cannot be counted out when their teams are down. Their teams simply refuse to quit. On the flip side, some fans cannot rest because they know their coach can blow a lead in the blink of an eye. It is a helpless, devastating feeling that can take an indefinite amount of time to heal depending on the final outcome of the game and the sequence of events leading to the opponent taking the lead.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the sake of determining which coaches most frequently find themselves involved on either side of a comeback, I defined a comeback as when a team is losing by 17+ points and goes on to retake the lead. It does not necessarily mean that they win the game, but it does mean that the deficit of 17+ points was erased at some point in the game. Also, more than one comeback (by our definition) will sometimes occur in a game and create an unhealthy range of emotions for all fans involved. To gain a better understanding of college football comebacks and the ringleaders behind them, I used the API of [CollegeFootballData.com](https://collegefootballdata.com/) for schedule, coaching and play-by-play data and SAS Visual Analytics to create meaningful graphs and charts of the data. The data pertains to the years 2001 (when CollegeFootballData.com's play-by-play data begins) to 2019 (the final year of complete play-by-play data)."
